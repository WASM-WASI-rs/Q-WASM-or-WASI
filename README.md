# Question: Where do I start - WASM or WASI? 

## WASM <-|-> WASI

This repo explains the difference between WebAssembly (WASM), which is primarily intended to run in browser-like environments (think web browsers, Node.js, and Deno et al.), and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), which runs in a growing number of locations outside of the browser (like on the server-side as functions or microservices, as application plugins, or in your data pipeline or database).
